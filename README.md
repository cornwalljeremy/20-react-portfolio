  ### About:
  I waited till the last min to do this. I only wqorked on this for one day and I wasn't able to finish. However I don't want to let my group down by not being apart of it. So I will take the hit on the grade. I was not able to get the portfolio link to work. I was also not able to get a gallery of pictures up. Some of the sizing is off and the footer is driving me nuts. If I would have alotted myself more time I would have done better. I do plan on continuing this project on my own time and figuring out all the quarks that I was not able too. Please be nice in the grading. You can see that behind the scenes I had a lot going on. As well as A nice burger function whe the window is made smaller with a nice animation.
